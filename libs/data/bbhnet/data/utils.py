    """Sample fixed-size kernels from a timeseries array

    Given an array of timeseries `x`, whose 0th dimension
    indexes independent samples and whos last dimension
    indexes time, sample `N` kernels from among the samples
    in `x` with length `size`. If `x` has only a single dimension,
    `N` must be provided and `N` kernels will be sampled from
    that single timeseries

    Args:
        x: array of timeseries to sample from
        size: the size of kernels to sample from `x` (in samples)
        N: The number of samples to generate. If left as `None`,
            a kernel will be generated from each row in `x` in order
            if `x.ndim > 1`, otherwise a `ValueError` will be
            raised.
        trigger_distance_size:
            Maximum amount of samples away from the closest edge
            of the kernel the trigger time (t0) is allowed. A positive
            value allows kernels where the trigger is not in the kernel.
            A value of 0 allows the trigger to lie anywhere in the kernel.
            A negative value sets a 'padding' from either kernel edge where
            trigger cannot lie.
        Returns:
            Array of sampled kernels of size `(n, ..., size)`, where
            `n = len(x) if N is None else N` and `...` represents
            all of `x`'s intermediate dimensions between its first
            and last.
